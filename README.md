# ~~Mo~~Wownero -  Such privacy! Many coins! Wow!

[<img src="https://suchwow.xyz/data/suchwow/image/to23moqn.jpeg">](https://suchwow.xyz/s/oh-really-9eda16b2/item)

## Introduction

Wownero is a Doge-inspired, CPU-mineable, solo-mining only, privacy-respecting memecoin. It was fairly launched on April Fools' Day in 2018. It is a software fork of Monero, but with a lite version of RandomX, larger ring size, and a fixed supply of 184 million coins emitted over 50 years. Wownero has no trusted setup, premine, or dev tax. Besides betting on online snail racing, the main use case of Wownero is micro-tipping meme creators with sound magic internet money. As a 100% community-driven, free and open source software, Wownero does not depend on billionaire shills or lame ass "influencers."

Unlike Opposing Projects.

## Release staging and Contributing

**Anyone is welcome to contribute to Wownero's codebase!**

If you have a fix or code change, feel free to submit it as a pull request. Ahead of a scheduled software upgrade, a development branch will be created with the new release version tag. Pull requests that address bugs should be made to Master. Pull requests that require review and testing (generally, optimizations and new features) should be made to the development branch. All pull requests will be considered safe until the US dollar valuation of 1 Wownero equals $1000. After this valuation has been reached, more research will be needed to introduce experimental cryptography and/or code into the codebase.

Things to Do, Work in Progress, and Help Wanted tasks are tracked in the [Meta](https://codeberg.org/wownero/meta/issues) repo.

Join `#wownero` on IRC OFTC to participate in development conversation.

## Scheduled software upgrades

Wownero uses a fixed-schedule software upgrade (hard fork) mechanism to implement new features. This means that users of Wownero (end users and service providers) should run current versions and upgrade their software on a regular schedule. The required software for these upgrades will be available prior to the scheduled date. Please check the repository prior to this date for the proper Wownero software version. Below is the historical schedule and the projected schedule for the next upgrade.
Dates are provided in the format YYYY-MM-DD.

        docker build -t git-wow:master -m 4g .
        docker run -it -p 34567:34567 -p 34568:34568 -w /home/wownero/build/release/bin git-wow:master bash

* Arch Linux/Manjaro

## Running Binaries

The build places the binary in `bin/` sub-directory within the build directory
from which cmake was invoked (repository root by default). To run in the
foreground:

    ./bin/wownerod

To list all available options, run `./bin/wownerod --help`.  Options can be
specified either on the command line or in a configuration file passed by the
`--config-file` argument.  To specify an option in the configuration file, add
a line with the syntax `argumentname=value`, where `argumentname` is the name
of the argument without the leading dashes, for example, `log-level=1`.

To run in background:

    ./bin/wownerod --log-file wownerod.log --detach

To run as a systemd service, copy
[wownerod.service](utils/systemd/wownerod.service) to `/etc/systemd/system/` and
[wow.conf](utils/conf/wow.conf) to `/etc/`. The [example
service](utils/systemd/wownerod.service) assumes that the user `wownero` exists
and its home is the data directory specified in the [example
config](wow.conf).

Once node is synced to network, run the CLI wallet by entering:

    ./bin/wownero-wallet-cli

Type `help` in CLI wallet to see standard commands (for advanced options, type `help_advanced`).

## Tor Anonymity Network

### Ubuntu

* `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install tor -y`
* `sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc`

add the following:
```
HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/wownero/
HiddenServicePort 34569 127.0.0.1:34569
HiddenServicePort 34566 127.0.0.1:34566
HiddenServiceVersion 3
```
save and close nano

* `sudo /etc/init.d/tor restart && sudo systemctl enable tor`
* copy [wow.conf](utils/conf/wow.conf) file and save it in same directory as `wownerod`.
* start wownerod like this:

```
./wownerod --config-file=wow.conf
```

* `sudo cat /var/lib/tor/wownero/hostname`

Copy your onion address and share node with others [here](https://monero.fail/?crypto=wownero).

To share your node over p2p, uncomment first line of wownerod.conf and add your onion address.

### Access remote Tor node from CLI wallet

```
./wownero-wallet-cli --proxy 127.0.0.1:9050 --daemon-address iy6ry6uudpzvbd72zsipepukp6nsazjdu72n52vg3isfnxqn342flzad.onion:34568
